## Stream Processing Steps :
* Identifying Events
* Modelling Events : Data/Process Modelling (Json, Avro, XML, etc...)
* Transporting Events : Continuosly transmit/transport events and turn them into a stream
* Processing Events

## Design Considerations
    1. Time Sensitivity
    2. Decoupling
    3. Data format Evolution
    4. Reliability
    5. Scalability
## Evaluating Alternatives
    1. Shared Database (DB's are good for Data at rest instead of Data in motion)
    2. RPC/RMI
    3. File Transfer
    4. Messaging

* Alternative Options
